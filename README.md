A treasure chest of Machine Learning algorithms! 🤖 From classic regression to powerful ensemble methods, this repo covers the fundamental building blocks of ML with code, explanations, and insights. Let's make machines smarter, one algorithm at a time! 🚀

# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction  

This repository contains a **machine learning model** for predicting the price of used cars based on various features like mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

Buying or selling a used car can be tricky! This project helps estimate **fair car prices** based on historical data using **machine learning techniques**. We explore data, preprocess it, and build predictive models to ensure accurate price estimation.  

## 📂 Dataset  

- **Filename:** `Used_Car_Price_Prediction.csv`  
- **Description:** Contains features such as car brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and price.  
- **Target Variable:** `Price` (the car's selling price)  

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing  

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling (Normalization/Standardization)  
- Train-test split  

## 🚀 Machine Learning Models  

We experiment with multiple models for price prediction:  

✅ **Linear Regression** – Simple yet interpretable  
✅ **Decision Tree Regressor** – Captures non-linear patterns  
✅ **Random Forest Regressor** – Boosts accuracy using ensemble learning  
✅ **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)** – Optimized for best performance  

## 📊 Model Evaluation  

We evaluate models using metrics like:  

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R-squared (R²) Score**  

## 🔧 How to Run the Project  

1⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Used_Car_Price_Prediction.git
cd Used_Car_Price_Prediction
```  

2⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

3⃣ **Run Jupyter Notebook**  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```  

4⃣ Open and execute `Used_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`  

## 📞 Future Enhancements  

🔹 Feature engineering (e.g., calculating car depreciation)  
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
🔹 Deployment as a web app using Flask or FastAPI
